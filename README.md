## Requirements


```
$ IDA Pro +7.0 (you can use Radar2 since IDA is quite expensive)
$ Router running Rompager 4.07 : there're immense number of them such as TP-Link TD-W8951*, ZyXEL P-660R, Billion BiPAC 51**/52**
$ UART to USB
```

The misfortune cookie vulnerability has been around for a while but still lacking an analysis which illustrate the techinical details of the vulnerability in public. According to Check Point the affected software is the embedded web server RomPager from AllegroSoft. Internet-wide scans suggest RomPager is likely the most popular web server software in the world with respect to number of available endpoints. RomPager is typically embedded in the firmware released with the device. This specific vulnerability was introduced to the code base in 2002. Moreover, the devices exposed are the one using RomPager services with versions before 4.34 (and specifically 4.07).

> For this tutorial I'll be using a ZXHN H108L that uses Rompager 4.07

```

Now lets use the serial port, first we must determine the Baud rate

```
$ sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0
```
>OUT :
```
speed 115200 baud; line = 0;

```

I use __minicom__, you can use anything from __screen__ to __HyperTerminal__, but I prefer this one for its stability ;)

### You must first deactivate the __Hardware Flow Control__
```
$ sudo minicom -s
```

```

    |    Change which setting?                                              |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
            | Screen and keyboard      |
            | Save setup as dfl        |
            | Save setup as..          |
            | Exit                     |
            | Exit from Minicom        |
            +--------------------------+
```

Now we're good to go:
```
$ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

This firmware has a set of hidden commands that are very useful to our dynamic analysis, the problem is that we can't see the registers nor set breakpoints but hopefully with these hidden commands we'd have that features, in order to see and use them we need to use __ATEN__. However, this command require a password, so what we can do now? let reverse engineer the firmware to find the password generator's algorithm.

(Static analysis) Let see the firmware file first:

```
$ binwalk ras
```

![binwalk1](https://benchaliah.github.io/assets/img/posts/binwalk1.png)

```
$ dd if=ras of=rom1.lzma bs=1 skip=85043 count=66696
$ dd if=ras of=rom2.lzma bs=1 skip=350259 count=3350556
$ lzma -d <rom1.lzma> rom1
$ lzma -d <rom2.lzma> rom2
```

Let see now the signature in the extracted files:

```
$ binwalk -Y rom1
```

```
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             MIPS executable code, 32/64-bit, big endian, at least 1250 valid instructions
```

__string__ is a great tool to get an idea of what a binary file is or what it contains, let see if we can find the password algorithm :

```
$ strings rom1 | grep -i aten
$ strings rom2 | grep -i aten
```

Apparently, it not because the firmware is still compressed, which means we must dump it from the router using the debugging mode:

```
$ ATDO bfc00000, 1f0000
```

![xmodem](https://benchaliah.github.io/assets/img/posts/xmodem_2.png)

The first thing that comes in mind if looking for a dispatch table. Why? just intuition, the only alternative is if-elif but it'll be a long set of them, in order to check for the validity of the password provided by the user, and here's what I got:


```assembly

ROM:800158D4                 .word CMD_ATEN
```

Keep in mind that MIPS word is 4 bytes, now let see the __CMD_ATEN__:

```assembly
ROM:8000FF84                 lw      $a0, 8($s0)
ROM:8000FF88                 jal     sub_80013654
ROM:8000FF8C                 li      $a1, 0
ROM:8000FF90                 jal     passwd_generator
```

and now: __passwd_generator__

```assembly

ROM:80010A78                 xor     $v0, $t9, $v1    # $v0 = $t9 ^ $v1
```
What we can conclude:

* $v1 is the seed value (generated by the ATSE command, zero if ATSE is not used)
* $t8 initially contains the last byte of MAC Address (last octet)
* 0xA11F5AC6 is the magic value we were looking for!
* Those two instructions: "$v1 = v1 << 8" and "$v1 = v1 >> 8" are equal to "seed = seed & 0x00FFFFFF"
* The loop with (sll-or-srl) is nothing more than a ROR instruction (ROR instruction on MIPS is a pseudoinstruction meaning it is typically emulated by using sll-or-srl sequence)
* $v0 is the result

Now let make a C program that does the same thing and compile it:

```C
U32 passwd_generator(U32 seed, U8 last_mac_octet)
{
      U32 b = seed & 0x00FFFFFF;
      U32 r = ROR(b + 0xA11F5AC6, last_mac_octet & 7);
      return r^b;
}
```

Now let run __ATSE__ to get the seed and use it (for instance: I got 088521A78838):

```
$ ./gen_pass 088521A78838
```

Let run the magical command we just hacked :p
```
$ ATEN1, A12F5AC6
```

```
ATEN1, A12F5AC6
OK

What we just learnt will help us analysing the rom files we extracted earlier 

```
code start: 80008000
code length: 1A5D4E
```

Now we can set the __ROM start address__ and __Loading address__ to __0x80008000__ after dumping a new rom file using:

```
$ ATDO 80008000, 1A5D4E
```

We know that __ATGR__ boot the router so what we could do is tracking it to find the instructions that passes the execution to the 2nd part of the firmware.

ROM:80011E98                 nop
```

Now we need to ask what is the address stored at $s0? Obviously we still can't set a breakpoint, we can't view the registers so we need to leak it using some trick. Fortunately, we can read and write memory, take a look on the following command:

```
ATWL 80011E94, ae30001c
ATGR
```

From what it looks like, this command patches the instruction at __0x80011E94__ with __ae30001c__ (the byte representation of MIPS __sw $s0, 0x1C($s1)__ instruction). By overwriting the original __jalr $s0__ with __sw $s0, 0x1C($s1)__ we have forced the program to store the contents of __$s0__ register to __0x8001FF1C__ memory address. So now the second's stage firmware will not be executed instead the "ERROR" message will be presented and we will still have the access to the first stage console, Hooray! So let's take a look what was stored at __0x8001FF1C__.


```
ATRL 8001FF1C
8001FF1C: 80020000
```

Gotcha! ... using __0x80020000__ we can dump and properly analyse the 2nd part of the firmware

To be continued ...
